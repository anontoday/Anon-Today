  <h3>Becoming Anon</h3>
  
<p>So much is changing for anon and the world: stay [excited, scared, and] grateful for life. 
  We do offer free domain usage with a partial verification of identity and intent [the previous use of word is only for the solidity of the anon.today domain within a spectrum of voice. I do not believe in the banning of any book; I still believe in the use of my own voice since I have registered this domain in solidarity.}. Your identity is sacred and anonymous on a level that you communicate through your definitions of boundaries.
