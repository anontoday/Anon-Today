  <h3>Becoming Anon</h3>
  
<p>So much is changing for anon and the world: stay [excited, scared, and] grateful for life. 
  We do offer free domain usage and hot takes participations with a partial verification of identity and intent [the previous use of word is only for the solidity of the anon.today domain within a spectrum of voice. I do not believe in the banning of any book; I still believe in the use of my own domain since I have registered this domain in solidarity.}. Your identity is sacred and anonymous on a level that you communicate through your definitions of boundaries.

<p> Please email andrew@anon.today for all hot takes, inquireies, conversation, scheduled lollygagging, tea times, exploratory planning, etc.</p>

<p> Someone please email me a number between 1-32; then I'll write how I feel about a saved piece of media for your opinionated response and hot take sharing?</p>
