<p> I am so confused with what to do next. I blew a tire tonight, and it has thrown my 48 hour off. this is here to remind me something can always move how ive felt about time. i cant stress; im cookin up; people thinkin theyre john wayne. bust out everything. rest in peace the drama king. time to throw a party for the day ones. we come out when it get dark. you dont like the way i talk, say something? pls (: </p>
